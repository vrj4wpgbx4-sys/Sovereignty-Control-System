## Purpose

- Provide individuals, families, and organizations with secure visibility and control over their digital identities and assets.
- Encode authority, permissions, and emergency controls in a verifiable, auditable way.
- Serve as a time-stamped record of design and development to support proof of authorship and ownership.

## Current Status

- Initial planning and architecture
- Language: Python
- Early experiments may be built in cloud IDEs (e.g., Replit) then synced here
